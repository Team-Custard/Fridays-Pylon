This is a custom Pylon script that we use in the Fridays. This bot is responsible for our verification and management of sandboxing member.

# How to use
Invite the Pylon bot to your server at https://pylon.bot and paste the contents of main.ts to the bot. Note that you will have to change a lot of things to get this to work for your server. It is not recommended that you use this entire script for your server.
